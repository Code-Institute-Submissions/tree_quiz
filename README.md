Practical Python: Tree Quiz
============================
This projectâ€™s goal is to prove my understanding and capabilities in developing web applications using Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is the Milestone Project in Practical Python module for the Code Institutes Diploma in Software Development.

The Tree Quiz is a pictorial quiz, where the user is asked to identify the native Irish trees shown in 10 pictures. The user and the users game playing history is stored, so that the user can leave the game and return at any stage by simply signing in with the same username. This allows for multiple users to play at the same time so long as they are signed into different browsers using different usernames. A leaderboard of the top 5 scores is also maintained.

UX
----
This application was developed with an educational end use in mind. The user/s would use this application to be more familiar with the native flora of Ireland by repeating the quiz until they score 100%.  

__User Stories__

User stories were developed to guide game play and desired functions.

* As a site visitor I expect to have a access to instruction before deciding to sign in and play. 
* As a site visitor I expect to be able to view the leaderboard without having to sign in.
* As a player I should be able to enter my username before starting the game.
* As a player I expect that only valid username entries will be accepted.
* As a player I expect that I will be informed of if the username entered has already been used and if so what is the users playing status.
* As a player I should to have each tree image presented to me one at a time, with a form to enter my answer.
* As a player I should be informed if my answer was right or wrong before moving on to the next image. 
* As a player I should expect to have two attempts at answering each question, scoring higher marks for submitting a correct answer on the first attempt..
* As a player I should see my progress at each question in the quiz, with the question number, attempt and current score clearly shown.
* As a player on completing the game I expect to have my scores validated against other players and my own past scores, and be shown the leaderboard.
* As a player after seeing the leader board I should be given the option to exit or play again.

__Mockups__

Mockups were developed using a free online mockup tool, FluidUI. The mockup wireframes allowed for greater visualisation of the how the application should look before starting creating the HTML templates. 
JPGs of the mockups can be found at GitHub repository for the project at https://github.com/dcasey720/tree_quiz/tree/master/mockups.

Features
-----------------
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

__Existing Features__

__Features Left to Implement__
* Include green/ read to indicate if the answers were wrong or right.
* Develop code so that the images are not shown in the same sequence during each game.
* Include more trees, make the game longer.
* Display a hint for the second attempt at a question.
* On the Game Over screen show all the pictures, displaying which ones were answered correctly and which ones were wrong. Use a list to save if the user got each question wrong of right.
