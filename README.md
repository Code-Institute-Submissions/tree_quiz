Practical Python: Tree Quiz
============================
This projectâ€™s goal is to prove my understanding and capabilities in developing web applications using Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is the Milestone Project in Practical Python module for the Code Institutes Diploma in Software Development.

The Tree Quiz is a pictorial quiz, where the user is asked to identify the native Irish trees shown in 10 pictures. The user and the users game playing history is stored, so that the user can leave the game and return at any stage by simply signing in with the same username. This allows for multiple users to play at the same time so long as they are signed into different browsers using different usernames. A leaderboard of the top 5 scores is also maintained.

UX
----
This application was developed with an educational end use in mind. The user/s would use this application to be more familiar with the native flora of Ireland by repeating the quiz until they score 100%.  

__User Stories__

User stories were developed to guide game play and desired functions.

* As a site visitor I expect to have a access to instruction before deciding to sign in and play. 
* As a site visitor I expect to be able to view the leaderboard without having to sign in.
* As a player I should be able to enter my username before starting the game.
* As a player I expect that only valid username entries will be accepted.
* As a player I expect that I will be informed of if the username entered has already been used and if so what is the users playing status.
* As a player I should to have each tree image presented to me one at a time, with a form to enter my answer.
* As a player I should be informed if my answer was right or wrong before moving on to the next image. 
* As a player I should expect to have two attempts at answering each question, scoring higher marks for submitting a correct answer on the first attempt..
* As a player I should see my progress at each question in the quiz, with the question number, attempt and current score clearly shown.
* As a player on completing the game I expect to have my scores validated against other players and my own past scores, and be shown the leaderboard.
* As a player after seeing the leader board I should be given the option to exit or play again.

__Mockups__

Mockups were developed using a free online mockup tool, FluidUI. The mockup wireframes allowed for greater visualisation of the how the application should look before starting creating the HTML templates. 
JPGs of the mockups can be found at GitHub repository for the project at:

Features
-----------------
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

__Existing Features__
* The home page greats the user with a brief intro, provides a text box to sign in, as well as links to the leaderboard and game instructions
* Players.json file stores the game data for all players as a list of dictioaries. In the format of:
       [{"cur_score": 0,
         "attempt": 2, "name": "name1"
         "cur_question": 5,
         "high_score": 60,
         "game_num": 2}] 
* If the player signs in with a username already used it will load up the players data on record.
* The username must be of the form "^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$". This requirment is set in the html code.
* Once the player enters a username a brief welcome message is displayed, informing the player of their current game status. This allows the user to enter in a different username if they are a new player, before playing the game.
* Each question's data is stored in a tree_lib.json as a list of dictioaries. in the format of:
       [{"question": 1,
         "tree_image": "/static/img/arbutus.jpg",
         "tree_name": "arbutus"}]
* As the game progresses the question number is incremented by one and the relevent image and tree_name/answer are retrieved using the question number.
* The player is presented with the image of a tree, a brief request to enter the tree name, along with an input box for the answer and sumbit button.
* The answer may not contain any spaces and must be of form "^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$". This requirment is set in the html code.
* The player can keep track of their game with the progress states diplayed on screen, current question, attemp number and current score are displayed. The attempt number is hidden in smaller screen resolutions.
* Once the player submits an answer the answer is processed, there data is updated in the players.json file and a feedback message is displayed on the screen.
* If the player answers correctly a green tick and  congraditalry message is displayed and 'Next Question' button is made visible.
* If the player answers incorrectly on their first attemp at the question, a red x with a message stating that their answer was incorrect and they have another attempt, is displayed,
* If the player answers incorrectly on their second attempt at the question, a red x with a message stating the correct answer is displayed, along with the 'Next Question' button.
* The player gets 10 points for every question answer correctly on their first attempt and 5 points for answered correctly on their second attempt.
* Once the 10th question has been sumbmitted the player is presented with a Gam Over screen, displayed their final score and a a game feedback message. 
* The feedback message compares the players current score to their high score on record as well as to the leaderboard and displays an approriete message.
* The a 5 ranked leaderboard is also displayed. The leaderboard data is stored in leaderboard.json. To be included in the leaderbord the player must score higher than their high score on record and higher than the lowest score on the leaderboard.
* If the player scores the same as their high score it does not make any changes, but if the score is the same as the lowest score on the leaderboard it knocks out the older player.
* From the Game OVer screen the player can play the game again without having to reenter the username.

__Features Left to Implement__
* Include green/ read to indicate if the answers were wrong or right.
* Develop code so that the images are not shown in the same sequence during each game.
* Include more trees, make the game longer.
* Display a hint for the second attempt at a question.
* On the Game Over screen show all the pictures, displaying which ones were answered correctly and which ones were wrong. Use a list to save if the user got each question wrong of right.

Technologies Used
-----------------------

* __FluidUI__ (https://www.fluidui.com) was used to develop wireframes for the initial UI design mockups.
* __Python3__ (https://docs.python.org/3/) was used to develop all back-end code.
* __HTML5__ (https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) was used to develop front-end templates.
* __CSS__ (https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) was used for styling of front-end templates.
* __Flask__ (http://flask.pocoo.org/) microframwork was used through out the project in interacting between the back-end code and front-end templates, rendering templates and aquiring data.
* __json__ (http://www.json.org/) was used to store and access game play data.
* __Bootstrap 3.3.7__ (https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css) was used for more effective CSS layout styling. 
    - __Boostrap Grid__ system was used for content arrangment and responsive behavour when moving between different screen sizes
    - __Boostrap Navbar__ was used for the main navigation. Collapsible menu was utilised for lower screen resolutions.
    - __Bootstrap Forms Controls__ were used for the user actions.
* __Font-Awesome 5.3.1__ (https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.3.1/css/all.css) was for the icons in the header, footer and quiz template.
* __Unittest__ (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) unit testing framework was used for the testing of none template rendering functions.

Testing
-----------------------

__Code Validation__

* __Python__ was validated using http://pep8online.com/. Both run.py and test_quiz.py are pep8 compliant.
* __HTML__ was validated using https://validator.w3.org/. Due to the python code embeddeded in the HTML templates there were a number of errors.
* __CSS__ was validated using https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator. No  errors were found.
* __Spelling and Grammer__ was validated using Google Docs.

Deployment
------------------------

__Hosting__

The application is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed at:

https://irish-tree-quiz.herokuapp.com/

__Deployed vs Development__

There is only one code difference between the deployed and development application version.

|       Code       | Deployed | Development |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | 
| app.run(debug= ) |  False   |   True      |       

Leaderboard.json and players.json are updated during game play and so may differ between the development and deployed versions.
